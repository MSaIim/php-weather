Everything is already setup for you. Just upload to a php enabled server. 

If you would like to use your own API key, then obtain a free key from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/appid). Edit `$api_key` inside [`scraper.php`](https://github.com/MSaIim/php-weather/blob/master/scripts/php/scraper.php) to your key.

+ You can change the default location inside [`scraper.php`](https://github.com/MSaIim/php-weather/blob/master/scripts/php/scraper.php).
+ The location can also be changed on the website by either editing the url `?location=area_here` or by editing the location shown on the site.
